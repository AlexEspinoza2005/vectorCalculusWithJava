# Vector Calculus with Java

Welcome to the **Vector Calculus with Java** project! This repository contains a collection of Java programs focused on vector calculus. It serves as a practical resource for learning and understanding vector manipulation.

## Description

This repository serves as a learning resource for vector calculus, providing various Java implementations that illustrate how to work with vectors. Each program demonstrates different calculations and manipulations of vectors, including:

- **Calculating vector components** based on magnitude and angle.
- **Vector addition** and **subtraction**.
- Computing the **dot product** and **cross product** of vectors.

Explore the provided examples to deepen your understanding of vector operations!

## Requirements

To run the programs, ensure you have the following installed:

- **JDK 8** or higher: Make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed to compile and run the Java programs.
- **NetBeans** or any Java IDE: You can use any Integrated Development Environment that supports Java, but NetBeans is recommended for ease of use with this project.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexEspinoza2005/vectorCalculusWithJava.git
